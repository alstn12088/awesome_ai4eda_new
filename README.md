## Papers
### High Level Synthesis
High-level synthesis (HLS) provides automatic conversion from C/C++/SystemC based specifications to hardware description languages (HDL). Particularly for HLS, ML has been adopted to produce fast and accurate result estimation, improve efficiency of Design Space Exploration (DSE) and assist DSE through an active-learning methodology.

### FloorPlanning & Placement

Based on the netlist after synthesis, FloorPlanning and Placement aim to assign the netlist components to specific locations on the chip layout. Better placement assignment implies potential of better chip area utilization, timing performance and routability. In order to achieve a better placement design for VLSI design, ML-based methods are recently applied to predict the possible challenges in further steps of physical design flow (e.g. routing steps).

### Routing

Routing is one of the essential steps in VLSI physical design flow based on the placement assignment. Routing steps assign the wires to connect the netlist components on the chip. At the same time, routing steps need to satisfy the requirements of timing performance and total wire length without violating the DRC rules. The machine learning approaches are considered as powerful tools for congestion and timing prediction in detailed routing.

### Testing and Verification
Testing and verification is one of the most important process in chip design. However, with the diversity of applications and the complexity of design, traditional formal/specification testing can no longer meet the demands of various industries. Recently, more and more ML algorithms are used in test and verification process. The papers in this section aim at applying machine learning methods to solve testing and verification problems, making fast analog/RF system testing,  building simplified estimation model, inferring and predicting the test results, optimizing sample strategies and even generating high quality test benches.

### Machine learning for SAT Solver
SAT plays an important role in circuit design and verification, error diagnosis, model detection of finite state machines, FPGA routing, logic synthesis and mapping, register allocation, timing, etc. At the heart of a traditional SAT solver is a search engine that may require exponential runtime. Lately, with the advancement of neural network in representation learning  and solving optimization problems, there have seen an increased interest in generating and solving SAT formula with neural network.

### Analog
In the analog design flow, the topology of circuit is firstly determined for certain applications. Then the size of devices in selected topology are optimized to meet the exact specifications like DC gain or GBW. Recently, machine learning techniques are introduced to solve the device sizing  and topology selection problems automatically.
